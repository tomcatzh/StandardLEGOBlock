# Product Overview

## Parametric LEGO Basic Module

A parametric 3D model generator for LEGO-compatible bricks created with OpenSCAD. The project generates fully compatible LEGO bricks with customizable dimensions optimized for 3D printing.

### Key Features
- **Full LEGO Compatibility**: 100% compatible with real LEGO bricks using official specifications
- **Parametric Design**: Easily adjustable width, length, and height parameters
- **3D Print Optimized**: Considers printing precision, structural strength, and clearance requirements
- **MakerWorld Ready**: Supports parametric customization on sharing platforms

### Target Users
- 3D printing enthusiasts who need custom LEGO-compatible bricks
- LEGO builders requiring specific brick sizes not available commercially
- Educators and makers using LEGO for prototyping and education
- Model sharing platform users (MakerWorld, Thingiverse, etc.)

### Core Value Proposition
Enables creation of custom LEGO-compatible bricks with precise dimensions that maintain full compatibility with the official LEGO system while being optimized for 3D printing constraints.
